The goal was to support business applications in the sector of agricultural insurance.

In particular, we would provide tools for insurance companies to predict the health of ongoing insurance products and tools for the commercialization of parametric insurance products, which could have saved the companies 5-10% of the average cost by avoiding claim adjusters interventions.
